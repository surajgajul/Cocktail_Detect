**Cocktail Type Prediction**

This project makes use of CNN models to predict the type of cocktail based on image. It further provides basic information about the item, like nutritional values and ingredients used in concocting the drink.
The potential use cases and objectives of our project are:

Our project could be used in health and wellness contexts, where individuals are interested in making healthier beverage choices. By providing information on the nutritional content of cocktails, it could help individuals make more informed decisions aligned with their health goals.

It could also potentially protect users from allergic reactions because the application lists out all the ingredients used for making the cocktail.

Hotels, resorts, and cruise ships could incorporate our project into their amenities, offering guests an interactive experience for exploring and ordering cocktails, complete with ingredient information and nutritional details.

Cocktail is a beverage that has plethora of choices to choose from, which means it tough to remember their names. So this project can help customers recognize and order a drink that they are interested in just by taking a picture.
